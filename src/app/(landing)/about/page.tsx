            <p className="leading-[1.6]">
              JED's event creation procedure is simple to use; users can input
              details, set schedules, and customise the event to suit their
              requirements. The full nomination feature of the app makes it easy
              for organisers to collect and handle nominations, ensuring a
              systematic and fair procedure.

              Ticketing is another area where JED excels. The app offers tools
              to create different ticket types, manage sales, and track
              attendees. This ensures that organizers have complete control over
              the ticketing process and can provide a smooth experience for
              participants from start to finish.
